## Lost or Stolen Passports
If your passport is lost or stolen you must report it to the State Department right away. 

## How to report your lost or stolen passport
Online: use the wizard to submit form DS-64 online
By phone: call toll free at 1-877-487-2778 (TTY 1-888-874-7793)
By mail: use form DS-64 (PDF, Download Adobe Reader) and mail it to the address on the form
Once you have reported your passport lost or stolen, it is invalidated by the State Department. It cannot be used if it is found.
## How to replace your lost or stolen passport
If you’re in the United States and your passport is lost or stolen, you must use form DS-11 to apply for a new passport in person. Follow the guidance from the State Department, which is based on how quickly you need your new passport. 
If you’re outside the United States, contact your nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate to replace your lost or stolen passport.
## What to do if you find someone else’s lost passport
If you find a U.S. Passport in the United States, mail the passport to:
U.S. Department of State
Consular Lost and Stolen Passport Unit
Attn: (CLASP)
CA/PPT/S/L/LE
4TH FLOOR
1150 Passport Services Place
Dulles, VA 20189-1150
If you find a U.S. passport while abroad, return the passport to the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate.
If you find a foreign passport in the U.S., return the passport to the issuing country's embassy or consulate.
